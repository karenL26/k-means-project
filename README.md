# K-means Project
> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

In this small project you will use the k-means algorithm to segment houses based on their coordinates and median income.

You can find some basic exploratory and the data preparation [here](src/explore_k_m.ipynb).

The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).

The dataset was obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/k-means-project-tutorial/main/housing.csv).
